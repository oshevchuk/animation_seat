                    <p>Sliding Seat</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Using this adjustment will allow you to change the depth of you seat so that it
                        can be better suited to the length of your legs. Users of different heights will want to
                        either lengthen or shorten the seat depth so that the appropriate amount of your legs will
                        be
                        supported.</p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: To use this control, locate the paddle on your left hand side. Next?
                        while holding this paddle in an "up" position, cautiously use a slight @scooting@
                        motion with your body (as you are seated in the chair) to make the seat's depth either
                        increase or decrease.</p>

                    <p>Tilling</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Being able to change the tilling angle of your backrest means that you can contact
                        that you back makes with the backrest. Set the angle adjustment at a closed angle relative
                        to the seat in order to allow more constant contact, or at a an open angle relative to the
                        seat in order to have the backrest make less contact with your back.</p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: You backrest tilling angle can be adjusted with a single level as shown
                        in the demoWith some chair models, you will need to hold up the backrest tilling angle while
                        making your adjustment, and then release the level to lock the backrest at a specific
                        tilting angle. While the level is unlocked, you can use your body weight to lean back and
                        forth to change the tilling angle</p>

                    <p>Pneumatic Lift</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Using this control allows you to change the height level of your seat to better suit
                        your individual preference as determined by your height.</p>

                    <p>Back Height Adjustment</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Using this adjustment allows you to change the height of just the backrest portion of
                        your chair.
                        Doing so will allow your back to receive more, or less, complete support from the backrest, and
                        will also allow you to customize where the lumbar support area will make contact with your
                        back.</p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: As illustrated in this demo, adjust the height of your backrest by placing
                        one hand on each side of your backrest either from a seated position, or while standing next to
                        your chair. Then, while using equal pressure, employ a controlled lifting motion to raise the
                        height of your backrest. The clicking sounds will indicate successive levels at witch you can
                        leave the backrest height. Stop when you've reached your desired backrest height</p>
                    <p>To return the backrest to its bottommost height position, first lift the backrest all the way to
                        the TOP, until you can lift no further. Then allow the backrest to return to its bottommost
                        height position, being sure that the seat of your chair does not impede the backrest.</p>

                    <p>Tilling Backrest</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Being able to change the tilling angle of your backrest means that you can contact
                        that you back makes with the backrest. Set the angle adjustment at a closed angle relative
                        to the seat in order to allow more constant contact, or at a an open angle relative to the
                        seat in order to have the backrest make less contact with your back.</p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: You backrest tilling angle can be adjusted with a single level as shown
                        in the demoWith some chair models, you will need to hold up the backrest tilling angle while
                        making your adjustment, and then release the level to lock the backrest at a specific
                        tilting angle. while the level is unlocked, you can use your body weight to lean back and
                        forth to change the tilling angle</p>
                    <p></p>
                </div>

                <div class="variant" id="i6">
                    <p>Tilling Seat</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Being able to change the tilling angle of your seat means that you can control the
                        amount of lean backwards or forwards (see demo movie of "Forward Tilting" for detail on
                        activation the forward lean feature) of the seat of your chair. Adjusting this tilting angle
                        will allow you to be more comfortable in your seat by giving you control over, amongst other
                        things, the level of pressure caused by contact between the seat surface, and the underside of
                        your thigh/knees.</p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: In most cases where this type of adjustment is available, the control paddle
                        that permits this adjustment to take place can be set to an always free-floating open position,
                        or a locked in closed position. In some cases, however, this function will be regulated by a
                        control paddle that returns to a locked or closed position when the paddle is released. In both
                        scenarios, to adjust the tilting angle, adjust the control paddle up (see movie for
                        demonstration) and use your seated body weight to lean forward or backwards. After setting the
                        tilting angle of your seat to the desired position, you may need to return the control paddle to
                        the closed</p>

                    <p>Rocking Tilt</p>
                    <p>Benefit: Engaging the Rocking Tilt feature of your chair will enable you to rock back in forth as
                        with rocking chairs (thus the name).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adjustment Details: To activate your chairs rocking chair motion capability, lift up on the
                        level indicated in the demo movie to permit free-floating and rocking. Please note: before
                        using your chairs Rocking Tilt feature, please ensure that you've carefully adjusted the tension
                        level of your chair to property counter-balance your body weight(see demo: Tension Knob).

                    <p>Tension Knob</p>
                    <p>Benefit: By making this adjustment, you can make limited changes to the level of resistance
                        you'll
                        fell when using the Rocking Tilt feature (see demo: Rocking Tilt). Please be sure to properly
                        adjust this resistance before utilizing the Rocking Tilt feature.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adjustment Details: To adjust your chairs level of rocking-motion resistance, rotate the knob
                        underneath your chairs seat counter-clockwise (from the seated users perspective) to increase
                        resistance, or clockwise to decrease resistance. Several turns may be necessary before you'll
                        start to notice any effect on the tension level of the chairs rocking motions. Proceed with care
                        in making this adjustment as achieving proper tension levels is important to the safe operation
                        of your chair</p>

                    <p>Benefit: This adjustment comes in handy when you want to lean forward as you're working, but
                        still maintain some contact between your chairs backrest and your body. if you can imagine how
